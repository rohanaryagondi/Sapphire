# Workboard

**Where each contributor's agent finds its pending work.** One section per person. If a task isn't here under
your handle, it isn't yours to start. This is the live assignment state; the *protocol* for claiming/assigning
is `dev/DELEGATION.md`, and the *lifecycle* for building is `dev/METHODOLOGY.md`.

**Status values:** `assigned` → `claimed` → `in-progress` → `in-review` (PR open) → `merged` / `blocked`.

> **For Hayes's and Gavin's agents:** you currently have **no assigned work** — do not start anything yet.
> First time in the repo, run `bash dev/setup-contributor.sh <handle>` and read `dev/CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md`.
> When Rohan assigns you a task it will appear under your section below with a brief link. Wait for it.
