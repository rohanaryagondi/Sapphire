# Workboard

**Where each contributor's agent finds its pending work.** One section per person. If a task isn't here under
your handle, it isn't yours to start. This is the live assignment state; the *protocol* for claiming/assigning
is `dev/DELEGATION.md`, and the *lifecycle* for building is `dev/METHODOLOGY.md`.

**Status values:** `assigned` → `claimed` → `in-progress` → `in-review` (PR open) → `merged` / `blocked`.

> **For Hayes's and Gavin's agents:** you currently have **no assigned work** — do not start anything yet.
> First time in the repo, run `bash dev/setup-contributor.sh <handle>` and read `dev/CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md`.
> When Rohan assigns you a task it will appear under your section below with a brief link. Wait for it.

## rohan  (`@rohanaryagondi`) — lead + approver
> **Overnight shift (2026-06-23→24): ✅ COMPLETE** — all 3 worker tasks merged: H (#22), K1 (#24), K2 (#26).
> Backend is now end-to-end-capable: front door serves the live firm (K1) + agents read their corpora at run
> time (K2). Suite 368 green. (Auditor: auto-merged all-green; none held.)

| Task id | Status | Goal | Branch / PR | Area |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frontend-and-data-planes` | ✅ **COMPLETE (A #37 + B #41)** | **Feature DONE.** A: two enforced data planes (`plane_for`, fail-safe boundary rule, derived `plane` on every fact). B: **transparent front end** — `frontend/` forks LOKA's Chainlit app (real repo untouched), re-points to in-process `live_engine.run_live`, renders the full firm process (plan→per-agent→dossier split by **two distinct planes**→roundtable **spread**→synthesis→partial-run banner); Demo + Live profiles; engine stays stdlib. Gate 2 ✅ + Gate 5 ✅ (PASS — bridge hits real engine, planes zero cross-contamination, app launches). Suite **463**. `site/` superseded. | — | [frontend-loka](frontend-loka.md) · [**brief**](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-sapphire-frontend-and-data-planes.md) |
| `loka-integration-plan` | ✅ merged (#34) | Analyzed LOKA source (read-only), wrote plan + `/api/run` wire contract + open questions; data-boundary ruled (separate planes). | — | [frontend-loka](frontend-loka.md) |
| `crossplatform-test-hardening` | ✅ merged (#22) | Fixed 3 cross-platform test fails (moat dir-name, cp1252). Suite 343 green. | — | [dev-harness](dev-harness.md) |
| `k1-run-live-service` | ✅ merged (#24) | **Keystone DONE.** `/api/run` now serves the harnessed `run_live` (`via=engine-live`); contract frozen + validated; canned = labeled fallback. Suite 356. | — | [frontend-loka](frontend-loka.md) |
| `k2-corpus-retrieval` | ✅ merged (#26) | **Keystone DONE.** Bucket-1 agents read `corpus/<id>/` at run time; corpus facts land in the dossier (traced, `provenance=corpus`), live path runs the gap. Veto rule intact. Suite 368. | — | [runtime-harness](runtime-harness.md) |

## hayes  (`@HayesStewart-QuiverBS`) — contributor
| Task id | Status | Goal | Branch / PR | Area |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `robyn-scs-endpoint-wiring` | **in review (PR open)** | **Standard.** Built `tools/robyn_scs/` — 10 callable endpoints wrapping the vendored `robyn_scs` SCS/STA pipeline (`vendor/robyn_scs/utils/`): `detect_events`, `run_scs`, `run_sta`, `load_stim_metadata`, `stim_mask_from_sidecar`, `merge_and_classify`, `visualize`, `discover_fov_quartets`, `run_fov`, `run_batch`. Thin wrappers, **`vendor/` untouched**, full pipeline NOT run (verified by import + `inspect.signature` alignment + a synthetic `detect_events`). Engine stays stdlib-only (numpy/scipy/pandas/matplotlib lazy in the tool). Suite 476. | `hayes/robyn-scs-endpoints` (PR open) | [tools](tools.md) · [**brief**](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-robyn-scs-endpoint-wiring.md) |
| `quant-fact-seams` | ✅ **COMPLETE** | All 4 seams shipped: gnomAD (#6) · GTEx (#9) · InterPro (#11) · g:Profiler (#12). | — | [tools](tools.md) |
| `experiment-design` | ✅ **ED-1 (#28) + ED-2 (#36) merged** | **Epic done.** Port Matt's `design-form-agent` → filled design sheet. `tools/experiment_design/` (extract.py + fill.py), vendor-verbatim, golden-locked, stdlib-only. Follow-up nit (next ED push): add `scan_direction`/`addition_protocol` to `_MENU_FIELDS` validation. | — | [tools](tools.md) · [**brief**](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-experiment-design-tool.md) |
| `semantic-corpora` (6) | assigned (after robyn-scs) | Build dual-source knowledge corpora for **patent-ip · post-market-safety · clinical-trial-registry · payer-market-access · manufacturing-cmc · dea-scheduling** — one PR per agent, per the **locked** method (FDA-memory is the worked example). Self-auth BenchSci for the EMET pass. **Ship your first, wait for review, then batch the rest.** | `hayes/corpus-<agent>` | [tools](tools.md) · [**brief**](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-semantic-corpora-delegation.md) |

> **Hayes — run autonomously** (`dev/CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md` §Autonomous operation): keep
> `bash dev/watch-assignments.sh hayes HayesStewart-QuiverBS` running (board + HELP + PR-review channels).
> **Status:** `quant-fact-seams` ✅ + `experiment-design` (ED-1 #28, ED-2 #36) ✅ — both complete.
> **🔨 NOW: `robyn-scs-endpoint-wiring`** (read the [brief](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-robyn-scs-endpoint-wiring.md)).
> The pipeline is **already vendored** for you at **`vendor/robyn_scs/`** (read its `VENDORED.md` + the
> 8-endpoint map). Build `tools/robyn_scs/` that wires callable endpoints around the vendored `utils/` —
> **don't modify `vendor/`, don't run the full pipeline** (verify by import + `inspect.signature`). Engine stays
> stdlib-only (heavy deps live in the tool). Branch from latest `main` (`git pull` first). Then your 6 corpora.
> **PR flow:** you have a PAT → **open your own PRs** (`gh pr create --base main`); the watcher's pr-review channel
> works. (If `gh` ever fails, the token-less push→approver-opens fallback remains sanctioned.) Blocked? `dev/HELP.md`.
> Always branch from the **latest `main`** (`git pull` first; merge `origin/main` if it moves). Blocked? `dev/HELP.md`.

## Shared backlog (unassigned — Rohan assigns from here)
Pulled from `status/OVERALL.md` open items. To assign: move a row into a person's section above, set status
`assigned`, and link a brief in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

| Task id | Suggested owner | Goal | Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`frontdoor-wire-run-live`~~ | rohan | ✅ Folded into `frontend-and-data-planes` (active above) — the new `frontend/` connects directly to `run_live`; `serve.py /api/run` already serves it (K1). | [frontend-loka](frontend-loka.md) |
| `aso-design-tool` | hayes | Build the ASO Design tool; feed designed sequences into the `aso-tox` `sequences=` channel | [tools](tools.md) |
| `scenario-coverage` | gavin | Broaden captured scenario coverage across the 10-axis variety matrix | [engine](engine.md) |
| `retire-mocks` | — | Audit + honestly label/retire remaining mock surfaces | [tools](tools.md) |
| `chronic-tox` | hayes | Scope + integrate the chronic-tox model (roadmap) | [tools](tools.md) |
| `crossplatform-test-hardening` | rohan/gavin | Fix 3 pre-existing cross-platform test failures Hayes flagged (HELP.md, resolved): moat clone-name test hardcodes `sapphire-capability-map`; `test_scenarios`/`test_trace_view` assume UTF-8 (fail on Windows cp1252). Low-risk: derive the moat suffix from the repo root; add `encoding="utf-8"` + guard the `✓` stdout write. | [dev-harness](dev-harness.md) |
